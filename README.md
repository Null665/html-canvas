A few homework exercises I did for a computer graphics course

* fractal.html - an interactive fractal, choose how many steps to perform
* chess-static.hml - a static scene of a chess board made with threejs. Looks good, though I guess it could be optimised resource-wise

If you accidentally have the same homework exercises and you copy my code instead of doing it yourself, I hope you fail and die.
